              3mo •      

   I am excited to share that I have accepted the 
   position of Event Planning Voyager with Marriott 
   International at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. 
   A huge thank you to the University of Georgia 
   Hospitality & Food Industry Management program 
   and to Hayley Rice, for guiding me along the way 
   and helping me find my place with Marriott in the 
   Voyage Program. I am so thankful for this opportunity 
   following my graduation in May, and I can't wait to 
   begin this new chapter!

It’s so exciting to see how much you’ve grown at SRNS. From starting as an intern to 
now stepping into this new chapter, it’s truly well deserved!
